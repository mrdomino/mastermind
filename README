Mastermind, written in Ruby, using Shoes.

Provides 4 difficulty levels (3 serious, 1 joke), each of which
spawns a new game of Mastermind with a random puzzle. Within
the GUI, we can click on colors (or type numbers that they
correspond to) to select them, and then click on circles in the
current guess to make them the selected color. If we get the
guess right, we win; otherwise, the game shows us what merits
our guess has. We repeat until we run out of guesses or win.

Obviously, this program requires Shoes. Get it at <http://shoooes.net/>.
If Shoes is on your path, you can even run it from the command line:
  $ bin/mastermind
